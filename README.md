# rank-my-tracks-app
The project, titled “RankMyTracks”, will be a web app designed as a final project for WDD 330. It will help users rank all songs within any album or artist’s entire discography via a Swiss-style tournament that matches two songs up against each other at a time. The program will determine a ranked order from most- to least-liked song on the list.
